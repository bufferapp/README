# README
Welcome, friend! 👋 This is the Buffer Engineering Team Wiki. It's is a living, evolving project that exists to guide you through all the info you need to know to be a happy and productive Buffer Engineer. It's a handy reference whether you're new, changing teams, or just like breaking down knowledge silos!  

## Contributing to the Wiki
All contributions would be glorious. An out of date wiki is so much worse than the occasional misleading new contribution, so please *err or the side of sharing your knowledge*.

Wikis are best when they're living and evolving. As an async, remote team, let's create a wiki that reflects our commitment to this way of work! 🌍

Here's how to contribute!
1. Be the change you want to see on the wiki ✨ Just edit it directly on Github ✏️
2. Got more of a suggestion than an immediate change? Open a PR 🙋🏽‍♀️
3. Not sure what the right info is, but you can see the current docs are wrong? Open an issue 🤔
4. Got lots to share? Awesome!🦄 Work on this wiki locally: `$ git clone git@github.com:bufferapp/README.git`
