## Contributing to the Wiki

All contributions would be glorious. An out of date wiki is so much worse than the occasional misleading new contribution, so please **err on the side of sharing your knowledge**.

Wikis are best when they're living and evolving. As an async, remote team, let's create a wiki that reflects our commitment to this way of work! 🌍

👉 **[Read how to contribute right here](CONTRIBUTING.md)!**

tl:dr;

1. Be the change you want to see on the wiki ✨ Just **edit it directly** on Github ✏️
1. Got more of a **suggestion** than an immediate change? Open a **Pull Request** 🙋🏽‍
1. Not sure what the right info is, but you can see the current **docs are wrong**? Open an **issue** 🤔
